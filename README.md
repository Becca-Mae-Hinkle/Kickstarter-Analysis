# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Our client Louise, a playwright, is looking at her past crowdfunding projects, with a focus on plays, to help support her new crowdfunding campaign. Louise wants a better picture of past successes and failures in the theater category. This information will help her decide what factors she should focus on with her upcoming project, a play "Fever".
## Overview of Project

###Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis is to help my client focus on what will help her play "Fever" succeed after her crowdfunding campaign.
