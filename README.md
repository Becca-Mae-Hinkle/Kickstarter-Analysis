# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Our client Louise, a playwright, is looking at her play "Fever", which came close to its crowdfunding goal in a short amount of time. She now wants to see how diffrent campaign managed in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using this dataset we will help Louise decide what factors she should focus on with her upcoming crowdfunding campaigns.
## Overview of Project
After looking into several thousand kickstarter campaigns across multiple countries I am able to present my client with an analysis of my findings and the direction she should go when she crowdfunds her new campaign.
### Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis is to help my client focus on when she should start her crowdfunding theater campaigns.
### Analysis and Challenges
In my analysis I have taken the data provided with a focus on theaters and broken it down into two parts. The first part is understanding the crowdfunding campaigns based on launch date and filtered according to the months of the year. The second part is looking at the theater data and filtering until we get to the subcategory of plays and seeing which campaigns had a "successful", "failed", or "canceled" rate. While I could filter this data more I find these visuals easier to read and understand.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Part one of my analysis is finding which month has the best outcome for crowdfunding theater campaigns.

In the line graph above we can see the outcome based on launch date from the available data given to us. This graph represents a narrower dataset so we can look at the subcategory of theater outcomes. We can see the successful, failed and canceled campaigns for each month. The data shows a steep incline for the month of May with successful months until September. When we look at December it is the only time that the successful campaign meets the failed campaign. I would suggest my client start her campaign in May, June or July based on this data.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next part of my analysis is looking at the outcomes based on goals for plays.
