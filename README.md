# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Our client Louise, a playwright, is looking at her past crowdfunding projects, with a focus on plays, to help support her new crowdfunding campaign. Louise wants a better picture of past successes and failures in the theater category. This information will help her decide what factors she should focus on with her upcoming project, the play "Fever".
## Overview of Project
After looking into several thousand kickstarter campaigns across multiple countries I am able to present my client with an analysis of my findings and the direction she should go when she croudfunds her new play.
### Purpose
The main purpose of this analysis is to help my client focus on what will help her play "Fever" succeed after her crowdfunding campaign.
### Analysis and Challenges
In my analysis I have taken the data provided with a focus on theaters and broken it down into two parts. The first part is understanding the crowdfunding campaigns based on launch date and filtered according to the months of the year. The second part is taking the theater data and taking the subcategory of plays and seeing which campaigns had a "successful", "failed", or "canceled" rate. While I could filter this data more I find these visuals easier to read and understand.
## Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Part one of my analysis is finding which month has the best outcome for crowdfunding theater campaigns.
